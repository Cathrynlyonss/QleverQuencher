            The human population requires daily water consumption to survive.
            However, many of us donâ€™t drink nearly enough of it. To solve this
            common problem we are providing a device to the public to strengthen
            hydration goals, better water consumption habits, and bring light to
            daily drinking trends.

            This device is called QleverQuencher and it essentially acts as a
            smart water bottle. This water bottle will be able to track user
            water consumption trends and display it in an easy to read way on a
            web application. If needed it will also send notifications via phone
            to users to either remind them to drink more water, or maybe even
            less.
